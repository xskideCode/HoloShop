# HoloShop: The Future of Minecraft Economy

> **Say goodbye to clunky chest GUIs and chat menus.** HoloShop is a premium, frictionless visual economy shop for Minecraft 1.21+. It replaces traditional text menus with a gorgeous, zero-lag 3D holographic interface that lives in the world with you.

## ✨ Why HoloShop?
For years, players have stared at generic double chests pretending to be stores. We thought it was time for an upgrade. Taking inspiration from the visual innovations of **thecyamera**, HoloShop renders dynamic stores natively in the world using strictly 1.21 Display Entities.

### 🚀 Key Features

*   **Zero-Lag Holograms:** Driven entirely by `ItemDisplay`, `TextDisplay`, and `Interaction` entities. **0 impact on server TPS**—even with thousands of items.
*   **Perfect Flat-Plane Physics:** The entire menu uses dynamic vector mathematics (`BukkitRunnable`) to swing around and face the player as a cohesive, unbroken 2D grid. The illusion of a flat HUD floating in the real world is flawless.
*   **Effortless In-Game Admin Editor:** Never touch a `shops.yml` file again. Easily add, edit, rearrange, and delete items from your categories fully in-game.
*   **Physical Anchors:** Place physical shop indicators (like a floating beacon) anywhere in your world. As players walk by, the beacon dynamically tracks them. Click it to open the shop wrapped right around the block!
*   **Auto-Close Memory Failsafe:** Menus instantly and cleanly despawn if a player walks more than 8 blocks away.
*   **NBT & Custom Model Support:** Flawlessly supports ItemsAdder, Oraxen, and any custom NBT resource pack items natively.
