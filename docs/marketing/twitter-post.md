# HoloShop Twitter/X Post Draft

**Thread / Post 1:**
Stop the scroll. 🛑

Minecraft Chest GUIs for shops are dead. 

We’ve spent the last 10 years staring at the same gray inventory screens. It’s time for an upgrade. 

Meet **HoloShop**. A zero-lag, 100% visual economy plugin that puts the store physically in your world. 👇

Taking massive inspiration from the incredible visual innovations by @thecyamera, HoloShop uses 1.21 Display Entities to create a theoretically perfect 2D flat-plane HUD that floats in the 3D world.

It tracks your gaze smoothly. It doesn't use ArmorStands. And it has ZERO impact on server TPS.

As an admin? You never have to touch a config file again. 
Everything is managed in-game. Hold an item, price it in chat, and it instantly syncs to the physical world—NBT tags, ItemsAdder, and Oraxen fully supported.

Also... Physical Anchors. Drop a shop anywhere in the world and watch the UI wrap around it.
