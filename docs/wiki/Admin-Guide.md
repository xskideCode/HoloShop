# In-Game Admin Guide

Managing your server's shop shouldn't require a degree in YAML formatting. HoloShop features a robust, fully in-game Admin Editor.

## Accessing the Editor
Type `/shop admin` (requires `HoloShop.admin` permission).
This opens the **Category Manager**.

## Adding a New Item to the Shop
1. Open the Admin Editor (`/shop admin`).
2. Click on the Category you want to add an item to (e.g., "Blocks").
3. In your own inventory, **hold the item you want to sell in your main hand**.
   * *Note: HoloShop perfectly saves all NBT data, enchantments, and custom model data applied to this item!*
4. Click the **Emerald Block [Add Item]** button inside the GUI.
5. The GUI will close. Look at your in-game chat.
6. Type the **Buy Price** in chat (e.g., `150`) and press Enter.
7. Type the **Sell Price** in chat (e.g., `50`) and press Enter. (Type `0` if you don't want players to sell it).
8. The item is instantly added to the shop and saved to your config!

## Deleting an Item
1. Open the category containing the item.
2. **Right-Click** the item you wish to remove.
3. The item is instantly deleted.
