# Welcome to HoloShop!

HoloShop is a premium, frictionless visual economy shop for Minecraft 1.21+. It eliminates clunky chat menus and traditional chest GUIs, replacing them with a gorgeous, zero-lag holographic interface. 

## ✨ Key Features
* **Zero-Lag Holograms:** Driven entirely by `ItemDisplay`/`TextDisplay` and `Interaction` entities, meaning 0 impact on server TPS even with thousands of items.
* **Perfect Flat-Plane Physics:** The entire menu uses dynamic vector tracking to swing around and face the player as a cohesive 2D grid without warping or breaking immersion.
* **Auto-Close Failsafe:** Menus instantly and safely despawn if a player walks more than 8 blocks away.
* **Effortless Admin Editor:** Never touch a `shops.yml` file again. Add, edit, and delete items securely in-game.
* **Physical Anchors:** Place physical shop indicators (like floating items or NPCs) anywhere in your world that dynamically track players walking by.
* **NBT & Custom Model Support:** Flawlessly supports ItemsAdder, Oraxen, and any custom NBT items natively.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Drop `HoloShop-1.x.x.jar` into your `plugins/` folder.
2. Ensure you have **Vault** installed.
3. Start your server.
4. Type `/shop` to browse the default categories!
